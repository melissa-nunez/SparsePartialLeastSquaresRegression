The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multisite study that aims to improve clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Many techniques were used to study the participants such as MRI scanning, PET scanning, and neuropsychological tests. The Reference Ability Neural Network (RANN) Study collected similar data on cognitively normal young and old patients.

The goal was to explore correlations between the subcortical volume and cortical thickness structures of the brain for both sets of participants. ADNI participants consist of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease while RANN participants are healthy patients. We wanted to compare the different brain associations and explore any possible differences between the sets of participants.

Multivariate sparse partial least squares regression was used to identify significant significant cortical thickness predictors of subvolume.
